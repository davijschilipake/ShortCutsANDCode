\f0\fs24 \cf0 This project will allow you to get announcements from your Apple devices during waking hrs. You are more than welcome to clone this project and update any part of it to fit your hearts content. Included in this file is a screenshot of the shortcut in case something happens with the iCloud link provided in the python script. Make sure to create an automation for the shortcut to run by itself. This project provides the base shortcut for you to call in the automation. \
