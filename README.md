This is the main folder in a series of shortcuts worked on and developed by me, Davi Schilipake. These shortcuts are ideas I have of things I want to automate or have in order to quickly complete something. These shortcuts are somewhat more complex than what is currently offered within the app itself. Which incorporates the Pythonista application in order to complete it. Testing is completed consistently as Apples ecosystem changes with each update and the shortcut app is often loosing and gaining new features.
